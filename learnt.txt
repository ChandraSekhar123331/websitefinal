instead of <b> </b> use <strong></strong>
instead of <i> </i> use <em> </em> tag
<hr> is br + givess a horizontal line there
<br> just gives a line break; usinng 5br's gives 5 lines space
uing br and bold and i is not at all recommended (br I think poses some css problems)
target="_blank" to open in a new window
<img src="" alt="" title=""> these title pops uo when you hover over image
don't use styling in html . it's a bad practice
tables have table tag inside of which we use thead tag and tbody tag like below
<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Name</th>
				<th>Id</th>
				<th>Employee Roll</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Harry</td>
				<td>190050001</td>
				<td>teaches onlie</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Hary</td>
				<td>19005001</td>
				<td>teaches ofline</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Ha</td>
				<td>0050001</td>
				<td>doesn't teach</td>

			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
   inline elements: em,strong,a,span
   block elementss: p,div,li, 
   inline elements take only the space required 
   where as block elements take up all the space (i mean the whole width) .So they start in a new line alway.
   two inline elements following come in a same line as expected.
   forms:
	1) form tag is there;inside it use input tag and see various types possible.Its the input tag that does the magic work
	2)label tag has for attribute where You should specify the "id"(not name!) of input box to which it has to corrspond
	3)sthng called select tag also exists in that you have to specify options.YOu can make one of them default by writing selected as attribute
	4)radio buttons are there ad check boxes also ... explore this
	5)text area tag is to make a text box 
	6)  In forms , input elments, name attribute is to specify under what name it has to be sent to backend
	7)

	id's and classes:
		two elements shouldn't have same id;
		if you have same class things give them class instead of id.
		If uniwue then only give id
		an element will have one id and an id can be given to only one elment
		but an element can have more than one class and a class can be given to more than one element
		syntax: class="redbg blackborder"
		class= use . in emmet.To get multiple classes a.b.c .Emmet takes div as base 
		id =use # in emmet

	semantic elements : 1)header 
						2)footer
						3)nav
						4).... google them.They provide semantic meaning to our webpage. Our webpage also will have better ranks in google search
			/*******************************         **************************************/

	CSS:
		1)inline CSS will be given more priority over internal CSS
		2)Don't forget to include your CSS in HTML.This is a very common mistake
		3)In internal and external CSS the one which comes later is the one having more preceedence...
		4)but You can use the !important property to make something non-overridable !important should be written at end of property just before semicolon even over the inline CSS
		5)selectors:
			Group Selectors: p,div (i.e combining selectors with comma)
			Class Selectors:like .myclass or p.myclass
			ID selectors :like #myid p#myid
			Element selector: p or simple div ir span {}...
		6)never believe in screen Shots because they can be changed easily by Inspect element temporarily
		7)fonts:
			font-family: websafe fonts, or google fonts
			font-weight:
			font-style:
			line-height:
			
		8)visibility:hidden and dispaly none aren't same ; visibility-hidden: means empty space will still be there but in  display:none -> empty space also won't be shown
		9)position:
			absolute:it's default is static not 0,0
			fixed:
			relative: relatiev w.r.t to it's actual position
			static:
			sticky:
