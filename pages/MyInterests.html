				<h4>Sport Programming</h4>
				<p>
					I like Competitive Programming bcoz of the challenges that the problems offer.
					Problems always involve a cute Logic which is often not so obvious. Coming up with a solution for
					such brain-storming questions feels really awesome to me.
					Competitive Programming also serves as a game in which i compete with my peers , my seniors.. .
					Competing with these highly talented people is a lot of fun.

				<h4>Machine Learning</h4>
				<p>
					I am highly interested in Machine Learning . Formulating a General Problem into a one which can be
					solved(mostly into a Mathematical one) lies at the heart of Machine Learning and I love this.
					I have also done my S.O.C in M.L . During that I have found Data PreProcessing part also pretty
					Interesting.
